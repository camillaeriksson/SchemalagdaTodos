Calendar we made as a group assignment in school using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
It consists of a header, a welcome section, a ToDo section and the calendar itself. 
When you add tasks to the ToDo, a circled number will appear on the corresponding date. 
If you wish, you can press the red X to remove ToDos. This will also update the calendar view
and remove a number from the circle (if there's more than one). In mobile view, the calendar 
section will be hidden and the whole page will exist of the ToDo section.
